othersource,Does the scholarship cover undergraduate
othersource,Undergraduate can't apply
othersource,You guys should teach data Analytics too and other tech courses
othersource,Requirements for Guarantor is too much
othersource,"I have laptop, I have accomodation, I can feed myself, I already have a rich community around me to network with, what else, can you train me"
othersource,"If this is not an all-expense paid training, then the first-class graduate there doesn't make sense"
othersource,first class and even second class graduates can get a fully funded scholarship in north America and be balling
othersource,They are not serious. imagine if it's when Nigeria is still Nigeria any first class graduate has several companies lining up to employ him or her
othersource,I think if you guys allow the ssce guys to apply it will be of great help. Not everyone has the nysc cert you guys needed.and not everyone can actually pay for the training
othersource,Why only for those with degrees? Do tech jobs only employ those with degrees. Una no wise aswear!
othersource,Can a SSCE student apply for it
othersource,Only for people with nysc
othersource,"I heard there is no job guarantee after the training, after paying heavily"

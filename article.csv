"Project Management Institute (PMI), the world’s leading association for project professionals, has announced a strategic partnership with the country’s leading ICT Training and Exam Testing Institute, New Horizons, aimed at boosting youth employability by making them industry ready for the Project Economy."
"New Horizons Nigeria is a franchise of the US-based New Horizons International, reputed for its global impact, with offices in 85 countries; a daily student attendance of over four million, and the first choice of the top Fortune 500 companies for their training needs."
"As part of the agreement, New Horizons, a Premier Level Authorised Training Partner for PMI, will roll out Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) to 19,000 university students. “This partnership is very strategic as New Horizons will deliver courses relevant to many industries and sectors driving Nigeria’s growth. When businesses compete for these skills, Nigerians can expect better employability prospects and remuneration.”"
"“Our certifications are globally recognised, which means Nigerian youth will also be able to tap into the burgeoning remote work market,” George Asamani, Business Development Lead, Africa, PMI, stated."

"Tim Akano, MD, New Horizons Nigeria said, the goal is to get as many Nigerians as possible trained on eight core PMI certifications. He listed the certifications as Project Management Professional (PMP), Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM), Agile Certified Practitioner (ACP), Portfolio Management Professional (PfMP), Programme Management Professional (PgMP), Project Scheduling Professional (PMI-SP), Risk Management Professional (PMI-RMP) and Professional in Business Analysis (PMI-PBA)."
"“The labour market in Nigeria is characterised by a significant mismatch between skills demanded by industry and those possessed by the youth. We see this across the continent and is not limited to Nigeria. We know what tomorrow needs; hence we decided to partner with PMI to bring training and education to the youth that is relevant in the contemporary labour market,” Akano stated."
"According to him, Nigeria is sitting on a demographic goldmine that could transform the country’s fortunes. However, he states further that without addressing the problems of skills mismatch and the lack of digital skills, the youth will continue to miss out on opportunities in the labour market."
"To ensure Nigerian youth can fully participate in the economy by seeking out in-demand skills, Akano said that New Horizons offers 100 percent scholarships to disadvantaged students. It also helps solicit sponsorship from well-to-do individuals and allows students to pay in installments."
Johnson Ejezie was initially daunted by the prospect of moving to Lagos from his home town in Nigeria’s south-east.
"The polio he contracted at a young age left him with lasting health problems, so he felt vulnerable living in a city where he didn’t have any family or friends to lean on."
"But what pulled the 26-year-old to Nigeria’s bustling metropolis was stronger than his fears – an invitation to take part in a bootcamp for Andela, a startup which pays young Nigerians to train as programmers and work for international companies."
"Andela acts as talent accelerator, scouting for smart and ambitious Nigerians with the potential to work as top-level developers for foreign firms. The ones who pass the rigorous selection process are paid what the company calls an upper middle class Nigerian wage while training. Successful alumni have been placed with for Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft as well as up-and-coming start-ups, all while being based in Nigeria."
Plight for programmers
"The idea is the brainchild of two entrepreneurs, American Jeremy Johnson, who made the  list last year, and Nigerian Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, selected as one of the World Economic Forum Global Shapers in 2012."
"“Andela began after my friend and mentor Jeremy Johnson visited Nairobi in 2013 and saw how a lack of career paths for young people was contributing to Africa’s youth unemployment,” says Aboyeji."
"“At about the same time, I had spent a year and a half in Lagos exploring new models of education that could raise the bar and tackle Nigeria’s chronic youth unemployment problem,” he adds."
"The pair put their heads together and noticed that while young Nigerians struggled to get jobs, tech roles in United States were hard to fill: “Even at $100,000 per year, Jeremy could not find a developer for his last company. That was when we decided to begin recruiting our first class.”"
Elite recruits
"With an acceptance rate of 1% Andela is arguably one of the most selective training programs in the world. In comparison, of applicants and . The training is four years long and starts with an online application, after which candidates take aptitude and skills tests. Those who make it to the next round have a face-to-face interview, and then undertake a two week bootcamp – the final selection stage. There, aspiring developers are taught how to build web applications and they are assessed on the speed at which they learn as well as their soft skills."
"Aboyeji doesn’t sugar-coat the fact that the selection process is grueling: “We are looking for brilliant young people who are potential leaders, and who have the grit and perseverance to get through a very tough program,” he says."
Tech talent
"So far 15,000 people applied for the scheme and Andela started training its first class of 100 developers in June of last year. The company is based in New York and Nigeria, a country chosen partially because its status as Africa’s most populous nation means it offers a wide pool of talent."
"“The primary and secondary education system remains strong here, but the youth population is growing very fast which makes the problem of youth unemployment chronic,” says Aboyeji."
"The strong emphasis of earning while learning is reminiscent of the apprenticeship system, something that Andela founders readily embrace."
"“We believe there is only so much you can learn in the classroom. But with practical work experiences, you can translate learning into habits that will make you a true professional,” Aboyeji says."
"He adds that in today’s globally connected world, it makes little difference that the companies young Nigerian programmers work for are based thousands of miles away: “With a reliable Internet connection, a world-class developer can add value remotely from wherever in the world they happen to be.”"
"“At the beginning of 2020, we had two strategic goals: to expand into international markets and to reach the grassroots with tech skills,” says Adeola Owosho, Vice President International Business at Utiva."
"“In the third quarter, we finally launched ‘The Nucleus’, an encrypted device with more than 40 well-curated pre-installed learning content with zero reliance on the internet, that allows Africans in the remote regions now access tech skill training.”"
"For an African, the cost of learning premium tech skills is too high because of the associated cost of the internet and its accessibility. More than 85 per cent of people abandon technology training because it is four times more expensive to access quality internet in most parts of Africa."
"This greatly contributes to the skill gap that Africa has, hence leaving us at almost 34 per cent unemployment rate. Without quality education, especially the type that connects Africa to the digital economy, it will be impossible to get out of poverty."
"For instance in 2019, 3.3 million jobs were unfilled due to this skill mismatch and the current trends makes Africa less competitive."
This problem is what Utiva aims to solve.
"Launched in 2017, Utiva is a fast-rising technology education company that develops and strengthens the African workforce by helping people learn premium digital skills and transition into new tech roles in emerging industries."
The first version of the Nucleus is designed as a dongle with about 300G storage space encrypted with 4 layers of security. The learning content are structured and well organised in folders – each folder has a unique passkey so learners access what they pay for only.
"“We currently work with students across 25 universities through a structured partnership with the Nigerian Higher Education Institutions where we have trained over 10,000 young Nigerians from these Universities. We are also one of the strategic partners of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) responsible for"
"“Utiva makes money through sales of the dongle. Today this is largely powered by B2B and B2G partnerships who fund the projects that deploy this dongle but, with just US$80, a young person from any location can also pay for the nucleus and get it within 24 hours."
"“Over the past 7 months, the Ninja Accelerator organised by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in partnership with Ventures Platform Foundation has supported our growth tremendously and fast-tracked the implementation of and roll out of over 5,000 nucleus devices. Our team grew by 25 per cent within seven months and we increased leadership capacity to capture new market opportunities. Most of all, we have also been able to increase student participation by almost 75 per cent.”"
"Andela, which helps businesses recruit software developers working remotely in regions such as Latin America, Eastern Europe and Africa, has raised a $200 million Series E funding round at a $1.5 billion valuation. The round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2, a $30 billion investment fund run by Japan’s SoftBank Group."
"The financing, which also included new participant Whale Rock and existing backers Generation Investment Management, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Spark Capital, propels Andela to unicorn status and underlines growing investor interest in tech that can help CIOs and other executives solve one of their biggest headaches: finding enough talent to support their ambitious digital strategies."
"Jeremy Johnson, cofounder and CEO of Andela, noted that the timing of the funding round also coincides with a seachange in the way that companies are thinking about work. “At the beginning of 2021 people internalized that we were not going back to the office,” he said. “Remote work is going to be necessary from a talent standpoint.”"
"Launched in Nigeria in 2014 and now headquartered in New York, Andela identifies potential recruits online and puts them through vetting procedures that include language proficiency and coding tests. The businesses that use it to find recruits aren’t just tech companies: Andela’s client roster includes household names in plenty of other industries, including Goldman Sachs, ViacomCBS and KraftHeinz."
"The company, which has raised $381 million to date and was last valued at $700 million in 2019, uses AI to help match engineers with recruiters. Employers pay it for successful placements and it also offers things such as advice on local employment regulations. It competes with broad-based remote work sites such as Upwork, as well as with ones that focus on tech workers, such as Semicolon and Decagon."
"CIOs and other tech leaders are now more willing to look beyond traditional recruitment hubs such as Silicon Valley, India and China—and are keen to use these services to help them do so. That’s one of the things that attracted SoftBank to Andela. “Hiring remote technical talent is one of the top challenges that companies face today,” said Lydia Jett, a partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a press release announcing the deal."
"To many CIOs, it’s  top challenge. According to IT industry group CompTIA, the unemployment rate for tech occupations in the U.S. was a mere 1.5% in August and there were over 320,000 unfilled IT job openings."
"“Employer hiring activity for software developers during Q3 increased 35% year-over-year, further confirming the white hot market for tech talent,” said Tim Herbert, executive vice president for research and market intelligence at CompTIA, in emailed comments to . “It serves as another wakeup call for many employers to reassess their recruiting and retention practices.”"
"Andela’s financial backers are betting that it can provide remote workers in distant locations to help fill some of these positions and ones in other markets too. The company says it has already placed thousands of engineers in roles and has built up an online community of over 100,000 developers who have pursued courses through its platform. In addition to training, it offers online mentoring and other services."
"Its rise hasn’t been entirely smooth. Last year, Andela laid off some staff and several of its top executives took pay cuts as the business reacted to what it thought would be a pandemic-induced lull in tech recruitment. But the market quickly bounced back as companies doubled down on digital investments to help them weather the economic storm."
Andela plans to use some of the money it’s just raised to expand its geographic reach (it currently counts engineers in over 80 countries) and to grow its 300-person workforce. It will also invest more in its technology infrastructure and look for acquisition targets.
"Johnson’s convinced there’s an opportunity to completely reinvent the traditional model of recruiting and was looking for more investors who share his view. “SoftBank is comfortable taking big swings,” he said. “And we believe this is an inflection point in global hiring.”"
"The tech training institution, which noted that education is the right of every child and access to basic education is one of the key targets of the Millennium Development Goals, said Streets2Click would purposefully equip these sets of individuals with practical I.T knowledge, hopes to place 50 per cent of the trainees on internships and create avenues for self-owned businesses for beneficiaries.
   
In a keynote speech, while briefing the media on the project, Centre Manager, NIIT Ikeja, Mrs. Fortune Ossy-Ohamara, said Streets2Click is a project conferred with every ounce of richness embedded in the NIIT global brand.
  
“As far as transforming an ordinary uneducated street youth from being an I.T novice to becoming an innovative, skilled, self -empowered and employable individual, this project is a conduit to ensuring a shining future in the global workspace. In today’s technology driven world, this project is set to give a global competitive advantage to potential beneficiaries,” she stated.
Speaking on implementation, NIIT Brands and Communications Team, Mrs. Naomi Job, said the project development programme aimed at facilitating opportunities for I.T skills for over 2000 youths in all the 37 Local Government within Lagos State. She informed that the programme is expected to start by February 10.
To achieve a qualitative impact, Job said the NIIT team has thoroughly considered strict parameters to achieving desired selection process.
According to her, free application forms to be made available to interested candidates at all local government development Areas and wards, churches, mosques and selected NGO offices.
She said the project is for ages 18 to 35 years with not more than SSCE as educational qualification.
Job said the training will include graphics design, python programming, video editing, hardware repair and maintenance.
According to her, the training which targets 1000 youths in the first phase, will last for six weeks."
"Skills and talent development corporation, NIITFortesoft is hoping to take about 2000 youths off the street through its new project called Street2Click.
NIITFortesoft explained that Streets2Click is an initiative targeted at empowering young, educationally disadvantaged Nigerian youths with in-demand I.T skills that will better position them for productivity, employment and self empowerment purposes.
NIITFortesoft has a proven track record in executing I.T-based projects in and around Lagos, in both corporate and educational organizations."
"On the desired result expected from the training, the Managing Director, NIITFortesoft, Lagos and Ibadan, Adedokun Oduyemi, said the firm wants to ensure the continuity of the Street2Click project towards achieving a socio-economically productive caliber of youths; to sustainably reduce youth unemployment and enhance their self-sustenance; to rightly position youths as front liners, providing I.T solutions to everyday problems using I.T skills acquired as Street2Click beneficiaries.
Oduyemi said they hoped that constitutionally mandated functions and decisions in field of youth development are implemented and sustained; to ensure more youths take advantage of the scheme to transform their local communities yearly; and ultimately, the country;
The MD said youth development is viewed and planned as an integral part of the national society’s development; youths are actively placed on paid employment such that will improve their standard of living; a continued involvement of youths in I.T programmes and structures of national societies as vital contributors, and that young people, now, more than ever, recognize and embrace technology as a socioeconomic game changer.  
Speaking also at the event, the Senior Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor, Akanbi Saheed, said the state government is in support of the programme, but appealed that the project should be extended to those who actually need them, especially those on the street and grassroots."
Facebook says it is collaborating with Co-Creation Hub (CCHub) to mentor and empower 12 startups in the ”Season 2 FbStart Accelerator Programme.”
"Kendra Nnachi, Facebook Startups and Developers Programme Manager, said on Thursday in Lagos that the programme had been extended to startups in Ghana."
Nnachi said that the second edition of the programme was a renewal of Facebook’s commitment to supporting  and empowering  local innovators and upcoming entrepreneurs in realising their business goals.
"The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the FbStart Accelerator is a research and mentorship driven six-months programme for innovative and visionary teams, daring to create solutions with advanced technologies."
She said that the accelerator programme provided the startups with the support they needed to build and optimise value driven products and match them with resources from Facebook and CcHUB.
"According to her, Facebook and CcHUB have started accepting applications for Season 2 of the FbStart Accelerator and have opened the programme to Ghanian innovators as well."
"”We are delighted to be bringing back the FbStart Accelerator programme to Nigeria for the second year, and now expanding this to applicants from Ghana."
"”Given our passion for connecting people and helping developers and entrepreneurs to thrive, we can’t wait to see how this year’s cohort develop and build solutions and technology to engage and empower people across Nigeria, Ghana and potentially the continent."
"”If you are building a solution that leverages advanced technologies – Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Data Science and Extended Reality – in Nigeria and Ghana, the accelerator is designed to help you grow,” she said."
"Ms Nnachi said that the season one of the programme saw 15 startup and student teams graduate on April 12, 2019."
"She said that as at April 2019, the graduating teams had cumulatively raised over $400,000 in investments and grants."
"”FbStart Accelerator Season 2 will be made up of 12 startup teams receiving up to $20,000 in equity."
"”They will receive funding, one-on-one mentorship from Facebook and CcHUB, access to corporates, industry experts, $16,000 in product credits and more."
"”Interested teams can apply via www.cchubnigeria.com/fbstart, with applications open until June 30, 2019,” Nnachi said."
"The Chief Executive Officer, CcHUB, Bosun Tijani, said that the hub was delighted to be renewing its support to innovators who were building the future of Africa."
"”By renewing our partnership with Facebook, we will continue to deepen adoption of advanced technologies across Africa and inspire the next generation of innovators to compete globally,” Tijani said."
"One of the participants in the 2018 cohort, Moses Olafenwa, the CEO of DeepQuestAI, said that the FbStart Accelerator programme had incredibly transformed its team from aspiring innovators to world-class solution creators."
"”Our team has the best possible support from some of the most diligent tech facilitators, in addition to the immense financial and infrastructural support we got,” Olafenwa said."
"Like in 2018, Facebook, CcHUB and partner hubs would also hold roadshow events in 10 states across the country."
"The aim was to enlighten students and entrepreneurs about deep-tech, while encouraging them to build solutions with advanced technologies and promote the programme."

"The Federal Government has tasked the Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT), Zaria to step up training for road transport operators to help in reducing massive death in the country."
"The permanent secretary, Federal Ministry of Transportation, Dr. Magdalene Ajani, disclosed this during the visit of some delegates from the House of Representatives’ committee on land transport in the National Assembly and commissioners and permanent secretaries of transportation ministries in the 36 states of the federation on an assessment tour of NITT, Kano Outreach Centre located in Dawakin Kudu area of the state."
Ajani said “the institute is poised not only to play its statutory role but on the path of becoming self-sufficient as well as being a revenue generating agency”.
"The director-general of NITT, Bayero Salih-Farah, said the Kano outreach centre is one amongst others located in Gombe, Ebonyi, Lagos, Abuja, Katsina, Benue and Ekiti (near completion), to provide professional training and acquisition of skills in the transport sector as well as other opportunities for technical learning."
"Farah who directed a demonstration of installed equipment, stated “there is a simulation section for intending motor vehicle drivers, a welding segment, automotive spray booth but most notable is a simulation provision for heavy duty vehicles such as forklifts, articulated vehicles, tractors and other earth moving vehicles."
“It becomes necessary as this class of operators do not go through the necessary orientation before taking the wheels hence putting lives and infrastructures of government at risk”.
"Farah further informed the term that the center was ready to train available persons and enjoined state governments, transport companies, individuals or participants under government empowerment learning schemes to take advantage of the opportunities being offered."
"House of Representatives member representing Zango Kataf/Jabba Federal Constituency, Amos Gwamna Magaji, speaking on behalf of his colleagues expressed delight with the out of the box initiatives being adopted by director-general and promised support of the House for the agency."
HP funds Utiva to train teenage girls in Kenya
"Historically, the positioning of technology and expertise has been an antithesis to women and girls and this is even worse felt in low and middle income communities."
"Low and middle income countries face an existential crisis. As the world moves to a digital economy, they face an obstacle: the lack of qualified manpower to fill critical information and communication technology (ICT) positions, a problem that is exacerbated by the low representation of women in these fields."
"HP, partnering with  wants to change this."
"In a bold attempt at salvaging the situation, HP commits $50,000 through , a tech education startup, to train 100 teenage girls in software development and product design."
"Despite strong demand for tech talents, there are not enough job seekers with the necessary technical skills, thereby threatening their ability to participate in what has proven to be a powerful driver of growth in the twenty-first century – the digital economy."
"In spite of a number of well-intentioned interventions by governments, civil society organisations, development organisations, and others, women are still facing significant barriers to entry and advancement in the technology space."
"With the right understanding of these challenges, HP, , and Girl Rising, a girl focused NGO, were able to work together, create programming and actionable insights that will facilitate the mobility of young girls into tech for better lives and greater gender parity."
Increasing women’s participation in tech is critical for three reasons.
"Firstly, increasing opportunities for employment for women improves gender equality, a fundamental human right. Secondly, empowering women leads to benefits for children and communities. Finally, narrowing the gender gap in the tech space could contribute to addressing the mismatch between the supply and demand for jobs in emerging countries."
"By the end of the 6 month project, HP,  and Girl Rising would have helped to improve the learning outcomes for 95 girls and young adults in core technology skills like Programming and Product Design."
"The project is geared primarily toward preadolescents between ages 10 and 14, at their most malleable development stage, giving them prescriptive and informational direction, providing high-achieving female role models who overcame initial difficulties, creating an environment that inspires curiosity in order to generate long-term interest in tech, build practical knowledge through capstone projects, while making spatial premium tech training available to all participants."
"According to , CEO of Utiva ‘’At , we have been helping girls become, stronger, smarter and more confident in themselves through improved tech teaching and learning and through programmes such as WOMIT we have granted lots of scholarships to women to learn tech’’. Utiva which is one of Africa’s top edtech startups was built to be the easiest and most efficient platform for people to transition into tech, positioning them to access more aspirational work opportunities in tech, last year alone Utiva trained over 10,000 people in tech."
"The goal of this project is to help train young girls in future-proof tech skills, building their interest and confidence in tech as a means to solve complex and simple global problems, and for the older ones, helping them get the requisite skill training and practice to facilitate their transition into better-paying tech roles."
"In low- and middle-income countries, like Nigeria and Kenya, there are fewer workers for the tech workforce, undermining one of the most important drivers of economic growth. Women could fill the gap, but they are currently underrepresented in the tech space, in particular in higher-paid, senior and management roles."
"The academics at HP, , and Girl Rising believe that enabling women to gain skills in this field would help develop the digital economy and increase opportunities for women. With women becoming more involved in using technology, their contribution to designing and developing tech products and services will be crucial to ensuring the technology is relevant for female consumers."
"Similarly, more international institutions, governments, and NGOs, as well as companies and foundations, should work together to find solutions to the complex barriers women and girls face, especially in low and middle-income countries where better inclusion of women in the tech workforce could help their economies and improve livelihood opportunities for people."
Innovation hubs have become a mainstay of Africa’s emerging technology ecosystem. Scratch the surface of the continent’s information and communication building blocks and you’ll likely find connections to a tech space.
More than 150 startups have launched out of Kenya’s iHub.  Incubator seed fund program formed out of Ghana’s Meltwater IT academy. Africa’s tech leaders are receiving Google for Entrepreneurs guidance through Nigeria’s  (CcHub).
"Over the last five years, Africa has seen its innovation spaces grow from a handful to hundreds, with large variations in focus and funding. Now many of these tech hubs are searching for sustainable operating models in the continent’s fast evolving ICT landscape."
"“There was a lot of excitement in this first big wave of hubs, but much of that has worn off. The next phase is about viability and digging in for the long-term,” said Neal Hansch, a board member and former director of the MEST incubator. “ ‘How do we generate revenue, cover our operating costs, produce real IT success stories?’ These are the challenges for Africa’s tech hubs today.”"
How many?
"Before the question of sustainability, several organizations have taken on the challenge of quantifying the continent’s tech hubs. How many are there? In 2012,  (an association of African innovation spaces), estimated around 70. A  between Zambia’s BongoHive and the Boston-based Fab Foundation tracked 170. The  ongoing African tech hub mapping project tallies 173. And  study estimated 314."
"The difference in the latter two estimates derives largely from classification. The World Bank uses a narrower definition of tech hubs and tech incubators for its count. GMSA mapped active “physical spaces that fall under the broad term of tech hubs: incubators, accelerators, co-working spaces, fab labs, makerspaces, hackerspaces and other innovation spaces.”"
Focus and funding
"While it’s impossible to classify all several hundred — and TechCrunch was unable to find a comprehensive financing survey — some general classifications have emerged. Many of Africa’s tech hubs hereto have been grant funded (either by governments, foundations, or both) and co-working space oriented. Some, such as , are more social venture focused. Others have been shifting toward for-profit, self-funding and/or startup accelerator models."
"One of Africa’s most visible tech hubs, Kenya’s , has been moving in this direction. Based in Nairobi, iHub is credited with inspiring the upsurge in innovation spaces across the continent. Founded in 2010, the center was largely the vision of Erik Hersman who  in Africa “to create a nexus point for technologists, investors and tech companies.”"
"Originally financed by grants, iHub has diversified its scope — now a mix of community tech space, co-working space and accelerator — and grown its funding from operations (consulting, events and corporate partnerships) to 70 percent. In early 2016 the IT hub  to become 100 percent self-financed through investors and operating revenue."
"iHub isn’t the only African tech space transitioning to making money and investments. , a Zambian innovation hub founded in 2011 almost entirely by grants, has been “moving towards cost/market-based prices for services” and is establishing a startup investment fund, founder Lukonga Lindunda told TechCrunch."
"In 2016, Nigeria’s CcHub launched its Next Economy accelerator program and , both of which take equity in early-stage startups while offering business support."
"Importance to ecosystem, finding sustainability"
"As the continent’s innovation hubs evolve, experts see their significance to African tech increasing. “The most important…role is that of catalysts. Ecosystems developing around technology need a catalyst,” said iHub co-founder Erik Hersman. “The government can’t do it by itself, the private sector plays a big role but it’s hard for actors to be completely neutral. You need somewhat neutral entities to connect and push the ecosystem forward.”"
"Technology consultant Tayo Akinyemi views hubs as structural pillars in Africa’s fragile IT landscape. “There are fundamental gaps in infrastructure that impact digital entrepreneurship, connectivity, technology development, and innovation. Hubs are providing that enabling infrastructure,” said Akinyemi, who served as the first Executive Director of . She also points to the continent’s demand for IT training. “Hubs are trying to fill those skills gaps,” she said."
"On sustainable models for Africa’s tech hubs, Akinyemi underscores the importance of location for those taking on more of a for-profit and investment focus. “There are certain countries and cities with more enabling ICT policies for tech spaces and startups,” she said.  “There needs to be a surrounding ecosystem mature enough to support viable startup, incubation, and accelerator activities.”"
"iHub’s Erik Hersman also names location as a major factor. “If you are in a primary city that has enough critical mass of all the right things, money, universities, international tech companies, media, entrepreneurs, etc., that’s a natural place to build successful tech hubs,” he said. “But if you are trying to build the same thing in the less connected, secondary cities of Africa, it becomes much more complex.”"
"When it comes to sustainable funding, whether grant or revenue based, Hersman suggests African tech hubs focus on service models that solve problems and support specific needs of an ecosystem. “When you look at examples, demand-driven models tend to find a way to exist. Identify something someone’s willing to pay for,” he said."
Neal Hansch links the future of Africa’s tech hubs squarely to successful companies.
"“Of all the different approaches, the question will be which ones prove they are  sustainable and have the biggest impact. The answer to that question will be which hubs launch and grow the most successful startups.”"

"Indigenous Information Communication Technology, ICT training institute, New Horizons Nigeria has partnered with Baptist Mission Schools to test the knowledge of Nigerian students on coding and robotics."
The organisers explained that the challenge was necessary to promote technopreneur skills among Nigerian children so they can be at par with the contemporaries across the globe.
"In testing their ability, participating students working in team were presented with a task of designing robot and projects, with the help of a mentor who trained them on a regular basis."
"Thereafter, each team submitted a design, business plan, and video pitch of their projects."
"The competition started with 3,782 students at the school levels in which 117 students qualified for the zonal levels while 47 students qualified for the finals."
"Speaking at the event, MD/CEO New Horizons, Tim Akano noted that future of Nigeria lies in the expertise with the fourth industrial technologies which included coding and robotics."
"He said, “It’s on that basis that New Horizons Nigeria partnered with Baptist Mission School to develop the yearly coding and robotics competition as the first phase for comprehensive fourth industrial competition amongst students."
"This will include other mission schools like Redeemers, Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, and Deeper life. We achieve all of this with our strategic partnership with international vendors like EC-Council, PMI, ISAACA, and Oracle.”"
"Earlier, the Director of Baptist Mission Schools, Dr. Tide Olalere, said “We are poised to ensure our children are not left behind in the 21st century ICT education.”"
"According to Olalere, qualified schools were judged based on app prototype, presentation slide, business plan words for code/robot description, creativity, design, potential usefulness, technical skill and presentation."
The grand finale of the challenge held at Bowen University in Osun State with stakeholders from the education and ICT sectors in attendance.
Winners were awarded cash prizes at every stage of the competition and a certificate of participation.
"… It’s a lie, Institution replies By Prince Osuagwu A Nigerian student Mr Adebola Aremu is having frustrations in his ICT carrier pursuit which he hoped to kick-start with a DNIIT certificate from a Nigeria based Indian IT training institution, NIIT."
Aremu saw his dream future in ICT propelled in 2009 with an advertisement that a reputable IT training institution was offering scholarship to Nigerian youths willing to pursue a career in IT. He wasted no time but applied.
"But that experience was to cost him over half a million Naira which he is paying on installments. However, his frustrations was not that his father, an average income earner, was going through thick and skin to fulfil the installment payment obligations but that the hands-on tools NIIT is providing to hone his carrier was going to set him further backwards and make him inferior to his peers in other parts of the world. Aremu’s aspirations is to match the knowledge, skills and competence of ICT whiz-kids in the global information super highway but he is troubled that the curriculum NIIT was running in Nigeria was far behind, outdated and could not give anybody that competitive edge."
"According to him, he has taken his case to the school authority who allegedly resorted to threats and bluffed him. He has also consulted a Lawyer who allegedly notified the institution that it was taking the rights of the students for a ride and the school authority could not bulge."
"However when Hi-Tech visited the institution’s Ikeja Headquarters, the Chief Operating Officer, Mr Sudip M, denied that his institution was running expired curriculum. He noted that NIIT is a global leader in IT education and training and could not have used faced out curriculum without detection, over the long period it has played in Nigeria, training IT students who have become pillars and beacons of Information and Communications Technology in many reputable organisations today."
"He admitted that Aremu was a student of the institution but added that he lacked the patience and mannerisms of a student . According to him, the young man enrolled to do a DNIIT which is a Diploma course in IT but has only done three out of the eight quarters required of him to graduate and so could not have crossed the basics of the course, let alone faulting the curriculum."
"Sudip also noted that Aremu had taken his case to the Ministry of Education which has come to evaluate the institution’s curriculum, promising to make its findings known before the week runs out. He added that the institution was not bothered with what the allegations of just one students when he fellow course mates have testified even in writing that they were satisfied with the learning structures in the institution."
"Meanwhile, when Aremu sauntered into Vanguard premises at the weekend, he looked much like a troubled soul whose aspirations are likely to be eroded. He opened up on his frustrations and this is his case:"
"“I started my course DNIIT at NIIT Gbagada Branch in February 2009, thinking all what I was told by NIIT representative at the Branch that if I enroll for the course I will be fully equipped in IT skills and industrially ready, was true. It’s close to two (2) years now and I have come to find out that everything we are being taught here in NIIT Nigeria is outdated. For instance,"
"* The windows operation system we are been taught is Windows 2000, whereas after windows 2000 there is Windows XP 2003, Windows XP 2005, Windows Vista, Windows 7."
"* The SQL which we where been taught is Microsoft SQL server 2000, whereas we have Microsoft SQL server 2005, Microsoft SQL server 2008."
"* Microsoft office which we were been taught is Microsoft Office 2002, whereas we have Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010"
"* The Microsoft Internet Explorer which our books are featuring is Microsoft Internet explorer 5.0 which is not a tab Browser, so some Java Script codes and other related technologies which we are been taught in the book given to us, don’t work with today’s version of Internet Explorer which uses tab Browser, whereas we have Microsoft Internet explorer 6.0, Microsoft Internet explorer 7.0, Microsoft Internet explorer 8.0. among others."
"“I tried several times to resolve the matter with our Center Head, since the beginning of my course when we have just paid a bit of our school fees because most of us pay in installments, but we were told that we are moving from lower version to the higher version. After paying almost all the fees, NIIT Nigeria is now telling us that we should pay extra money so that we can be certified in newer version of parts in our course which we have already paid for."
"I believe its rip-off for us here in Nigeria paying N 550,500 close to $4000 to be taught Faced Out Curriculum and in India where they pay less than $1000 for same course they are taught with updated curriculum."
“I have evidence of conversations between me and two NIIT student in India and a E-mail message sent to me from NIIT Ghana all showing that NIIT is using updated curriculum in those places and my father’s lawyer had written to them attaching those evidences yet no changes are coming from NIIT”.

The company in a statement posted on its official website describing the latest development said it will be focusing its efforts in Rwanda.
"“Today, we are announcing that we are closing the D0 program in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda."
"“In addition, we will be letting go of approximately 250 Andelans in Nigeria and Uganda with an additional 170 potentially impacted in Kenya, who we don’t believe we’ll be able to find meaningful work for over the next year.”"
"“Moving forward, we will be focusing D0 training efforts on our pan-African hub in Rwanda”"
“The reason for this action according to the statement is because most of the talents it needed are for the more experienced. The junior engineers brought onboard are too much than it could need.
“We now have significantly more junior talent than we are able to place.”
About 25 per cent of its talent (mid-level and senior engineers) are outsourced. The company claimed this made the necessary strategy to continually grow become more conspicuous.
"“As a result, we’ve come to the conclusion that Andela’s next phase of growth requires a strategic shift in how we think about talent.”"
"Soyinka pays tributes to Leah, compares her to Mandela"
"On the other hand, the company will be hiring an additional 700 experienced engineers by the end of 2020 to efficiently handle the demand for experts by its partners."
“We will hire another 700 experienced engineers by the end of 2020 in order to keep up with demand from our partners.
"“To continue creating junior engineering talent at scale, we will invest in the Andela Learning Community, through which we’ve already trained more than 30,000 learners in software engineering fundamentals.”"
Andela is one of the engineering organisations in Africa with more than 1500 engineers and partners with over 200 technology companies worldwide.

"The Digital Nigeria International Conference is a flagship awareness and annual programme in the Digital Economy sector. Further re-branded as Digital Nigeria to expand the scope in line with the core objectives of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS). The aim is to brainstorm on contemporary issues of relevance across the globe to address Nigerian challenges for sustainable socio-economic development. It is a veritable platform for the creation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) awareness, the development of the appropriate framework, and the setting of goals for best practices.
The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) under the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy in partnership with Domineum Blockchain Solutions a leading Distributed Ledger Technology Company in Africa hosted a one-day National digital economy awareness event tagged: “BLOCKCHAIN DAY” which happened on Wednesday, October 26, 2022, during the Annual Digital Nigeria International Conference and Exhibition from the 25th to the 27th of October 2022 with the target audience of over 2000 Blockchain enthusiast in Abuja. The Digital Nigeria International Conference and Exhibition took place at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria. The theme for this year’s conference was Digital Transformation: A Path to Sustainable Digital Economy and it was chosen to stimulate discussion on how the economy could take advantage of digital technologies to create value with the objectives to promote Digital transformation, Digital inclusion, Emerging technologies, Data protection, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship in Nigeria. 
The Blockchain Day aimed to converge and assemble Blockchain Experts, Blockchain Protocols, Blockchain Founders, startups, Academia, and Developers in the Blockchain Ecosystem – to showcase and share insights about the different platforms and solutions built on blockchain technology, as well as future emerging solutions. 
Over the past years, it has become obvious that emerging economies have come to the forefront of blockchain adoption, with Nigeria being one of the frontrunners.
The “Giant of Africa,” as proudly called, is making great strides in the adoption of blockchain technological innovation. According to a survey conducted by Statista in 2020, 32% of Nigerians have admitted to using or owning cryptocurrencies. These sheer numbers are perfect considerations when exploring Nigeria’s affinity for embracing blockchain technology. Hosted by the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA Nigeria). 
We had the Pacer Labs Executive team; Ray Sharma, General Partner, Pacer Ventures, the “Blockchain Day” keynote speaker, who spoke on blockchain as an emerging technology and practical application in the tech ecosystem today.

And Hadiza Saidu, General Manager, Pacer Labs who spoke on the approach to addressing the talent gap issues in the ecosystem today. The executive team also had a Q n A session with startup founders, and entrepreneurs, sharing their wealth of knowledge and expertise on pathways to setting the pace in the ecosystem of today, raising funds as a startup.
The conference provided a platform for networking opportunities, co-creation and collaboration, sharing experiences, mentorship and knowledge circulation, stimulating conversation on emerging technology and incentives, and export for tech startups.  Mr. Kashifu Inuwa, Director-General of NITDA, said “There are a lot of opportunities in Blockchain and it is critical in every business. Talent is the human component of technology and innovations with Blockchain and emerging technologies are about the new solutions one is bringing on board. So, you need to task yourself to know which solutions or offerings the industry requires.”
Mr. Mohammed Ibrahim Jega, co-founder Domineum said, “Blockchain is a technology that houses Cryptocurrency and many various ideas. It is essential to demystify it, enable young people to take a proper grasp and expose themselves to this game-changing technology and take advantage of the numerous opportunities it presents.”
A power-packed avenue for activities such as Keynote Speaking, Panel discussions, Fireside Chat, Training Sessions, Guest Speaking, Presentations, Pitch sessions, Questions, and Answer Sessions, Exhibition and Networking, and One-on-one interactive workshops with attendees from global industry leaders.

"Opolo Global Innovation inaugurates supervisory board for its Uniosun Tech hub Opolo Global Innovation, an innovation advisory platform, on Monday inaugurated a supervisory board to manage its Technology and Innovation hub, currently being constructed within the Osogbo campus of Osun state university.
Speaking at the inauguration, Dr Segun Aina, Chairman Board of Directors, Opolo Global Innovation, noted that the focus of the hub is for problem-solving through innovation and technology, as well as to be able to produce entrepreneurs whose products and services can compete globally.
He said “the idea behind creating the Opolo Global Innovation is to enable it to focus on four different areas that can improve the society. To make the state and the country become a digital economy, also using innovative ideas for both young and old people and to impact the necessary skill for the world of work today, not only for work in Nigeria but for work anywhere in the world.
“There are some skills that are required, both technical, digital and entrepreneurial skill that will make someone ready for the global work environment. We want to create a large number of new entrepreneurs, people that will set up their own businesses, contribute to solving societal problems while when those businesses prosper, they will be paying tax to the government and also employ people to work for them.
“So essentially in summary, what we do is incubation and acceleration of new businesses to grow bigger, not just regular but unique businesses that will solve societal problems in a way that we can scale them globally. Exposing the talents we have in Nigeria to be able to operate and compete at a global level in terms of products, solutions and services that they offer”.
He also added there is an existing partnership to ensure that participants get certified for the training that they will do through the hub.
“For programs that require certification, we have a partnership through the Fintech institute which is a sister organization with the Federal University of Akure for instance, and many other Universities to run some of the long programs that require certification.
“We are also creating the relationship with other Universities outside of Nigeria so that we can bring the town and the gown together in terms of knowledge sharing and then impart, the students, the lecturers and even people from outside the university can come and take part in what is happening in the hub.
Also speaking at the inauguration, the Acting Vice-Chancellor of Osun State University, Professor Adefemi Bello expressed gratitude to OGI on behalf of the University management, while promising that the management will ensure that the hub gets the maximum support needed.
He urged members of the board to take their duties as service to humanity and deliver more than what is expected of them"
"Opolo Global Innovation set to commercialise university research efforts Dr Segun Aina, Chairman, Opolo Global Innovation Ltd., says the company will continue to leverage global partnerships to facilitate commercialisation of innovations, empower innovators and entrepreneurs within and outside universities across Africa.
Aina said this at the end of the organisation’s two-day strategy retreat on Sunday in Lagos.
He said the company had continued to maintain its leadership position in building partnerships to improve product development process and commercialise innovation and problem-solving research in tertiary institutions in the country.
According to him, this will be realised through partnership arrangement with the University of Edinburgh.
He also said there were ongoing discussions with Oxford University; University of Toronto, Canada; Toronto Metropolitan University, and Tshimologong – the Incubation of University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.
“The retreat closely follows Opolo Global`s establishment of incubation hubs at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife and Osun State University.
“Plans are afoot to create additional innovation hubs at University of Ibadan, Ahmadu bello University (ABU), and Bayero University Kano (BUK).
“We look forward to working with funders globally in this space,” he said.
A research and development innovation expert at the strategy session, Dr Ayo Popoola, noted that “the game changing innovation hubs will promote both research excellence and developmental impacts of research and development outcomes.
He said that would thereby support the country’s global innovation competitiveness drive and development of its national knowledge economy ecosystem.
According to him, Opolo is well positioned to bring global opportunities to the doorsteps of Nigeria’s tertiary institutions for sustainable youth and talent development.
“Creation of decent and future jobs, enterprise and entrepreneurship development that will catalyse overall socio-economicl development of Nigeria while guaranteeing the economic prosperity of its citizens,” he said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Opolo Global Innovation Ltd., is an innovation enabler, incubator and accelerator with a focus on nurturing talents to become global innovators and solution developers.
It provides the springboard for innovators and funders who need opportunities to succeed leveraging global partnerships with communities.

"Opolo Global Innovation seeks ecosystem support to boost job creation
23/05/20220
Mr Francis Makinwa, Director, Opolo Global Innovation Ltd., says there is need for an ecosystem that supports innovations from start-ups to create more jobs that can boost national growth and development.
Makinwa said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos.
According to him, there is a need to pay serious attention to young Nigerians, particularly those with talents and willing to impact lives and communities positively.
He said Opolo as a springboard for innovators to succeed, understands that the nation must experience meaningful development, create jobs and improve livelihoods.
According to him ,the firm does not discriminate by not looking at gender, demography, state of origin and other variables.
Makinwa said; “So, we can talk about a young girl or boy who has ideas or solution, maybe that can solve a particular problem in the communities.
We leverage our resources to work with them, using technology to find solution to that problem.
“Even though, I mentioned technology, what we do is not just technology-based,technology  means we can scale it beyond the borders or  boundaries of Nigeria.”
Makinwa noted that the company, through its resources and partners, could help  persons with ideas remove their ideas from cubicles to commercialisation level.
According to him, Opolo has the mandate to set up hubs in many institutions across the country.
“We have set up to three hubs in Lagos, University of Osun State and Obafemi Awolowo University(OAU). So, it is a strategic decision because we feel that is the base of ideas- the learning institution where it is easy for people to stimulate themselves.
Editor’s Picks  BEDC raises alarm over missing FG - issued meters, begins audit
“This is because young people are inquisitive to think of everyday problem and provide solutions. That is why we are setting up those hubs in tertiary institutions,” he added.
Makinwa, however, said that the service was not only for students of learning institutions, but also for lecturers and researchers.
He noted that the company realised that a lot of professors and doctorate holders were doing quite well in research to solve peculiar problems in the communities.
“In most cases after conducting the research, they get funds and then leave it on the shelves. Therefore, Opolo is planning to partner with people like that to grow ideas that can scale into the market and generate revenue and as well as make impact within their communities.
“If you look at foreign organisations and investors, you will see that a lot of innovators come from universities and sometimes not even from the students but from the research communities.,” he said
The director said that the organisation planned to harness the potential of research communities in the country by providing a platform where high-tech business growth could be accelerated and in return for prosperity to such communities.
Makinwa said with Opolo having its focal point for innovation, start-up incubation, acceleration programmes such as technology transfer knowledge and skills impaction amongst others, the company also allows walk-in innovators.
He said that the walk-in option allows innovators to explain to the company what they do, how they do it and therefore give Opolo the opportunity to look at the possibilities of the ideas.
On whether innovators pay for the skills, knowledge and mentorship they receive, he said the organisation tried to find a balance between revenue generation, impact and supporting the communities.

“If you come to us with a ground breaking agenda that we feel it will solve a lot of problems and you don’t have a fund to execute it, why not we find a middle ground, in terms of supporting with resource and platform to do these things to create a win-win situation,” he said.
According to him, the organisation has recorded some success stories in terms of start-ups that are doing well since its establishment in 2019 during the COVID-19 lockdown.
He noted that the aspect of commercialising the research works started in January, making it a work-in-progress,.
” Right now, we are looking to doing more exponentially from Opolo Growth 1.0 and now, Opolo Growth 2.0.,” he said.
Also, Mrs Laide John, Managing Consultant for VA Consult, a management and financial consulting firm to Opolo, said the organisation was brought in to help in pivoting the next growth.
John said that Opolo engages innovators, using capacity building, infrastructure support through incubator hubs and centres,as well as mentorship and financing, which include funding, technical and advisory support .
According to her, Opolo Global innovation Ltd., is a very unique initiative that grows young and brillant minds who are passionate about science, technology, engineering and science.
“It is one of the initiatives that I would say is different. Many can’t find any organisation like Opolo Global in Nigeria.
The reason why I said that with all sense of responsibility is because of what we do.

“Opolo is quite different because you can be innovators. You don’t have to be an innovator just within the technological space. If you have fantastic idea that can scale for commerciability, then we can bring you on board and grow with you and of course give you the necessary support required to grow,” John said.
She, however, said many start-ups begin well but most times are not able to grow beyond four years ,mostly.
The consultant said, “With us, that is the different because we are able to provide support all through the process and also to accelerate you to scale up your commerciability.
“Based on fact and figures, many start- ups within the first five years fail. A lot of people tend to attribute it just to money but it is beyond money. Technical and management skills, particularly to run an enterprise because it takes resilience.
“We are also focusing in urban areas, but also rural areas which is where a lot of attention is not given. Infact, we call them ‘the underserved segment’ areas.”
Opolo Global Innovation Ltd., is an innovation advisory platform for innovators who need infrastructure and support network to grow, and for investors who need promising start-ups and ideas to invest in.

The Opolo initiative is a model for innovation and entrepreneurship in Nigeria through the University communities. The opinion was the submission of stakeholders from the government, industry, and academia at the commissioning of the hub at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife.
Speaking at the opening session of the two-day ""Opolo Osun Innovent"", the Deputy Governor of the state, Mr. Benedict Gboyega Alabi, described the initiative as a laudable development that will lead to growth and innovation in the country.
He said the Osun state government had signed a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) with the Opolo Global Initiative to expand the scope of engagements integrated into the recently launched ""Youth Development Policy"" of the state.
Delivering the keynote address, the Chairman of Opolo Global Innovation Limited, Dr. Segun Aina, OFR,  said the mission is to accelerate the growth of ideas that create opportunities through innovation, collaboration, creativity and engagement to foster human happiness.
The initiative would strengthen the triple helix of cooperation between the government, university and industry to promote commercially viable research and innovation.
In his goodwill message, the Minister for Youth and Sports, Mr. Sunday Dare, described the youth demography as the biggest driver of innovation. He was optimistic that the Opolo hub would provide immense opportunities for young Nigerians.
He urged Nigerian youths to learn from the examples of Unicorns like Flutterwave, Paystack and Opay led by young dynamic Nigerians who, through hard work, discipline and dedication, developed innovative solutions.
The Minister commended the Bank of Industry (BoI) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for addressing the funding gap for young entrepreneurs and noted that there is now a significant shift from empowering young people to investing in their innovative ventures.
In his welcome address, the Vice Chancellor, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Prof. Eyitope Ogunbodede, said the institution was proud to be the springboard for the Opolo initiative. He believed the project would grow in leaps and bounds to catalyze technology transformation in Nigeria.
He added that OAU Ile-Ife was the leading tertiary institution in the country, accessing research grants from the Tertiary Institutions Trust Fund's (TETFUND's) national research fund.
Mr. Benjamin Tobin, the Executive Director, Corporate Services of BoI, said the development financial institution remained a big supporter of startups and believed that the Opolo hub could scale into a critical tech cluster like the silicon valley in the United States.
The Executive Director further told stakeholders that the BoI had played a significant role in funding tech hubs in Lagos, Bayelsa, and Kebbi since 2019 and is looking at establishing four more additional seats.
The Executive Secretary of TETFUND, Prof. Suleiman Elias Bogoro, believed Nigeria had come to a critical point of building a vibrant knowledge economy. The Opolo hub was an opportunity to expand partnerships with the OAU Ile-Ife, BoI, Fintech Africa, and other industry players."

Innovation and entrepreneurship
On how hubs foster innovation/ entrepreneurship for local community, Ọpọlọ Innovation serves as a nexus point for the local startup community, investors, academia, technology companies and the wider private sector.
It aims to create a structure where people serendipitously interact with others that they would not typically meet.
It renders support through:
Capacity building programs
Startup funding
STEM education
Idea and research commercialization
Co-working space etc.
On the state of innovation/entrepreneurship in Nigeria, the innovation centre strongly believes that the entrepreneurial forces are relatively strong in the country, as the lack of jobs and a rise in poverty leave few other options for the Nigerian people.
“Although difficult due to a lack of resources, more reasons Ọpọlọ Global is dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship in the State.”
According to the innovation centre, developmental gaps remain very huge, despite the abundance of human and natural resources, Nigeria is blessed with. The many factors include poor leadership, mismanagement, corruption, nepotism, are responsible for this lacuna in the country’s Innovation growth.
On improving Nigeria’s technology, innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems, the innovation centre affirms that the public and private sector agents have a responsibility to prevent the deaths of many viable startups that would ordinarily make a considerable contribution to economic and digital transformation over the next decade.

"Nigerian-owned tech-hub, Utiva, has been accredited in the United Kingdom as an education and learning platform.
The Chief Executive Officer, Utiva, Mr. Eyitayo Ogunmola, told our correspondent that the listing was very important to the African tech ecosystem at this time when most companies on the continent were experiencing a high volume of brain-drain.
Utiva is designed to help young Africans learn technological-based skills and move them into new advanced jobs in the technological world.

“This is one of the very important steps to position our African talents among global competitors and put Nigeria on the map.
“Utiva started operations in Europe and the UK earlier this year through its intensive training and digital apprenticeship, with the core focus on helping Africans, both at home and in diaspora access the best learning program.” Ogunmola said"
"Eyitayo Ogunmola, a 34-year-old tech entrepreneur and Chief Executive Officer, Utiva, has kick-started a project tagged, “EyiEko Project”, to empower 10,000 young Nigerians with access to tech skill acquisition.
According to Ogunmola, this was borne out of his mission to eradicate endemic poverty through technological empowerment.
He said: “Tech brought me out of poverty and I am paying it forward to the next 10,000 young people. On this scholarship project, we are partnering with major leaders and community organizers to select young bright Lagos residents.
“Each young person accesses skill training worth N250,000 annually for five years.”
Ogunmola also noted that he has instituted a community support project to empower 5000 women and girls in Lagos State, adding that a leadership capacity development project for young aspiring leaders would also suffice.
“This N100 million project is designed to help women and girls in the Ifako-Ijaye community and its environ to develop skills that either help them start a new entrepreneurial journey or help them earn good income.
He said: “We are also partnering with leadership centres in Europe to help build the capacity of 2000 young Lagos residents, and we believe that everything rises and falls on leadership. Hence, the mission is to work with experts that can put our young, aspiring leaders in programmes that will help to develop their capacity, and this, according to our budget, will cost about N50 million to achieve.”
He added that the “EyiEko Project” will also endow 5000 widows with 500 micro-financing support.
“Through our endowment funds and NGO support partnership, we are mobilizing 500 microfinancing support for 5000 widows in Lagos.
“This project will deliver small loans with zero interest rates to people and widows living in Lagos State, and this will also go along with our rural youths rehabilitation programme for 5000 young people struggling in rural areas.”"

"Binance Charity, the philanthropic arm of Binance, the world’s leading cryptocurrency and blockchain infrastructure provider has partnered with Utiva, a technology education company in Africa that helps young people learn tech skills. The new partnership is set to educate 50,000 young people in technology and provide scholarships for 1,000 Africans in a 1-year intensive skill training program.
The education program is aimed at young people (18 – 35) from over 19 countries across Africa. It consists of virtual workshops, which will run every weekend over the next 12 months, where students will learn tech skills and access virtual mentoring as a part of the project design.
Additionally, students who partake in the training will have access to fully funded year-long scholarships, which will provide access to Utiva’s top technology skill training for free. The collaboration aims to build a path for economic prosperity for the continent through skill training and access to vast job opportunities in the technology and Web3 sectors.
“We believe the benefits and vast opportunities of Web3 must be accessible to all. Advancing tech education and professional training are critical to making this happen.
We’re proud to be partnering with Utiva, to engage the youth across Africa as we support the continent’s next generation of industry shapers.” said Helen Hai, Head of Binance Charity.
Launched at the Utiva office in Lagos Nigeria on Thursday, October 20, 2022, the workshop hosted about 50 young people who will be a part of the first cohort of people that will access the fully-funded training and sponsorship.
“Africans are talented and hardworking but most times, the constraints of resources can be a major limiting factor when pursuing a laudable aspiration like moving into technology. We are super excited that Binance Charity understands the African pain point and has partnered with us at Utiva to help thousands of Africans and break the barrier to entry for many,” said Eyitayo Ogunmola, CEO of Utiva.
At the launch workshop, students took part in a 4-hour training on Blockchain Technology and Software Development. This is the beginning of a 12-month commitment to the educational program.
Maxwell Maxwell, one of the students said, “It was my aspiration to learn Data Science but I have always been limited by financial constraints. Now, my dreams are close to being fulfilled.”
This initiative is part of the wider Binance Scholar Program launched earlier this year and now has active projects in Ukraine, South Africa, France, and Brazil. The initiative is enabling the next generation of digital leaders to develop their skills, knowledge, and experience without financial barriers."
"“At the beginning of 2020, we had two strategic goals: to expand into international markets and to reach the grassroots with tech skills,” says Adeola Owosho, Vice President International Business at Utiva.
“In the third quarter, we finally launched ‘The Nucleus’, an encrypted device with more than 40 well-curated pre-installed learning content with zero reliance on the internet, that allows Africans in the remote regions now access tech skill training.”
For an African, the cost of learning premium tech skills is too high because of the associated cost of the internet and its accessibility. More than 85 per cent of people abandon technology training because it is four times more expensive to access quality internet in most parts of Africa.
This greatly contributes to the skill gap that Africa has, hence leaving us at almost 34 per cent unemployment rate. Without quality education, especially the type that connects Africa to the digital economy, it will be impossible to get out of poverty.
For instance in 2019, 3.3 million jobs were unfilled due to this skill mismatch and the current trends makes Africa less competitive.
Launched in 2017, Utiva is a fast-rising technology education company that develops and strengthens the African workforce by helping people learn premium digital skills and transition into new tech roles in emerging industries.
“We currently work with students across 25 universities through a structured partnership with the Nigerian Higher Education Institutions where we have trained over 10,000 young Nigerians from these Universities. We are also one of the strategic partners of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) responsible for deploying. The Nucleus technology to train recent graduates in Nigeria,” said Owosho.
“Utiva makes money through sales of the dongle. Today this is largely powered by B2B and B2G partnerships who fund the projects that deploy this dongle but, with just US$80, a young person from any location can also pay for the nucleus and get it within 24 hours.
“Over the past 7 months, the Ninja Accelerator organised by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in partnership with Ventures Platform Foundation has supported our growth tremendously and fast-tracked the implementation of and roll out of over 5,000 nucleus devices. Our team grew by 25 per cent within seven months and we increased leadership capacity to capture new market opportunities. Most of all, we have also been able to increase student participation by almost 75 per cent.”"
"Binance remains committed to closing the gender gap within the industry. For International Women’s Month, Binance is hosting an 8-week bootcamp in collaboration with Utiva, to equip women with blockchain education, tools and skills.
As a whole, the blockchain industry is creating new opportunities for Africans with many being brought out of poverty, acquiring skills, getting employed and accessing financial systems not previously available to them. However, women remain disproportionately under-represented in the industry with 95% of crypto users being male according to Global Crypto User Index and women making up only 15% of bitcoin traders according to a report on Business Insider. Binance continues to aid in solving this problem.
The 8-week programme will kick off on March 26, 2022 at Utiva, Ikeja, Lagos and will be a hybrid event combining both physical and online events. Registration for the event will begin on March 8 and end on March 14, 2022, at Utiva Hive, 767 Somide Odujinrin Ave, Omole Phase 2 100271, Ikeja, Lagos. Application opens on March 8, 2022, closes on March 14, 2022, while the bootcamp starts on March 26.
With this event, the teams aim to show the multitude of career options in the crypto and blockchain space. Students will get to work on real-time projects where they will be able to apply the skills they have gained. This boot camp will also give women the opportunity to gain meaningful employment, thereby enabling them to be self-reliant and possibly employers of labour.
In line with the company’s commitment to Africa and the growth of the blockchain ecosystem, Binance continues to empower women, giving them the opportunity to learn, acquire skills and bring their value to the technology industry by creatively solving problems through innovation.
The event will provide an opportunity for participants to learn basics of blockchain, discover how others are using crypto in their everyday lives, and how to store value with crypto and earn on your crypto balances, understand real-world applications of the blockchain, understand crypto trading and how it works in simple terms and step-by-step, and get access to job opportunities"
"Nigeria’s ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) sector has grown from less than 1% of GDP in 2001 to almost 10% of GDP today. Nigeria has also surpassed South Africa to emerge as a premier investment destination with 55 active tech hubs raising a total of US$ 94.9 million. The country is also Africa’s biggest technology market and accounts for 26% of internet users in Africa, with 154.3 million internet users in December 2020. The tech sector’s growth offers new possibilities for Nigeria’s growing labour force in employment and entrepreneurship.
The Nigerian tech sector has benefitted from entrepreneurs moving to the country to set up companies in home country. Since then, tech firms have been established in energy, agriculture, banking, transportation, logistics, health, and finance. In addition, several large tech companies have emerged over the past few years; these have attracted international attention and funding. This has also resulted in rising demand for the recruitment of Tech professionals and freshers.
The Future of Technology in Nigeria. 
Nigeria’s tech sector has often found creative solutions to fill gaps left by the state. The fourth industrial revolution is the digital transformation in manufacturing/production and related industries, representing a new stage in the organization and control of the industrial value chain. The Internet of Things (IoT), Smart Factories, Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data are driving the future project – solutions must be ever faster, more diverse, more flexible, and more intelligent. The adoption of new-age technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, IoT etc., is the key to staying relevant and accelerating business.
How to stay relevant in the emerging Tech industry? 
As currently, every industry is inclined towards technologies. Therefore, being tech literate is equally essential and need of the hour. The truth is that technology is replacing the need for human workers at an alarming rate. It’s predicted that up to 800 million global workers will lose their jobs by 2030 and be replaced by robotic automation. Technology presents wonderful opportunities but also carries the threat that a professional is no longer needed. Hence, skilling and upskilling with the right technologies has become vital to sustaining this emerging Tech industry. 
How Aptech is helping students & professionals to skill and upskill? 
Aptech in Nigeria has recently launched a new curriculum of Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering (ADSE). The course helps students/professionals to choose from a wide range of Specialisations like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, IoT, Open-Source Technologies with .NET, Java, Oracle, and Networking. ADSE is a flagship and complete career-oriented program to prepare students for today’s ICT Industry. The course introduces Responsive website development, Application programming, Enterprise Apps development, Oracle Database Administration, IoT Application Development, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and a lot more. These new-age skills will help students and professionals to stay relevant and develop employment opportunities in the trending tech job market.  
Now is the time to embrace the change and make professionals indispensable and trendsetters with the right I.T. Skills.

"To actualize the quest for knowledge based economy being projected in the Vision 20-20-20, a leading information technology company with focus on information technology solutions and deployment, Centre Point Network Limited has inaugurated Enugu state Aptech Computer Education Centre.
The company which has Franchise on Computer Education with Aptech Mumbai India, has a growing clientele base ranging from government parastatals, corporate organizations, the Oil and Gas sector, small and medium scale enterprise (SME), retail outlets of computers and IT equipment for all and sundry.
Inaugurating the centre, the Chairman Senate Committee on Communications, Senator Gilbert Nnaji and Chairman of the occasion explained that only through a broad-based, sound and qualitative technology education that Nigeria can effectively achieve the Vision 20-20-20, which he said Centre Point Network Ltd shares same belief.
He said with an institution such as this, a Computer Education Centre that can effectively kick start and sustain the processes, is apt, noting that a seed whose fruits shall bring about sustainable breakthrough and advancement in technology education has been sown to the glory of God and blessing of humanity.
While promising to continue to invest his energies and resources in the enhancement of education, Nnaji said he will use his position as the Chairman of Senate Committee on Communication to ensure that secondary schools in the country practically integrate ICT into their curricula. “I have of course sponsored a motion on that. Through a gradual and systematic approach, the dividends are manifesting”.
Prince Nnaji, who reeled out some of his contributions to the ICT education project, said he attracted over 30 functional ICT laboratories distributed in the secondary schools within the zone while many more are being packaged. “All the tertiary institutions within the state – i.e. both federal and state – have one or two similar though advanced projects.
“A massive, fully air-conditioned and equipped Rural Information Technology Centre in Neke, Isi-Uzo LGA with over fifty (50) work stations for smooth wireless internet access towards manpower enhancement and improved service delivery under the Rural ICT Programme of National Information Technology Development Agency, NITDA, is the first of its kind, east of the Niger’’.
“Additionally, I nominated the Institute of Management and Technology, IMT, Enugu and the Federal College of Education, Eha-Amufu, as beneficiaries of the Advanced Digital Access Programme for tertiary Institutions (ADAPTI), under Schools’ Support Programme of the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, and many more”. He added.
Senator Nnaji who came under attack for poor representation of his constituent by some powerful cabals in Governor Sullivan Chime administration explained that he also attracted the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), which is the Commission’s Learning Centre for South-East Zone, to Nike.
Work is nearing completion for the construction of Information and Communications Virtual Library in a tertiary institution in Enugu-East LGA. A project he said has enormous capabilities and opportunities for all-round development and employment is being funded by NITDA.
“The importance or relevance of this Centre to our national development especially education cannot be over emphasized. Just last week, the 20th Nigerian Economic Summit was held with theme as Transforming Education through Partnerships for Global Competitiveness’’.
One major challenge identified as facing our educational sector presently was how to connect our institutions of learning to the industries in order to grow our economy into a robust one.
Hence, I enjoin public spirited individuals and organizations to partner this Centre with a view to taking due advantages of the inherent opportunities to make our youths very strategic component of our economy and also complement government’s resolve to reduce poverty through ICT skills acquisition.
Chief Operations Officer, Centre Point Network Limited, George Opara in his keynote address said their drive into computer education was predicated on the need to empower various ICT graduates/non graduates to be self-engaged after attending their courses amongst other benefits which he said includes;
“Flexible payment options for students, affordable fees for rich contents courses, nonstop programme with no issue strikes, flexible lecture, time-table strict adherence to minimal hours required for each course and standardized syllabus with Middlesex University London ICT course outline among others”.
Opara explained that graduate from the Centre with Aptech Certificate can participate in the NYSC scheme.
“We enjoy broad technical alliance with established information technology companies and OEM companies which give us the privilege of stress free service delivery to clients at rates that is a premium buys for our customers”.
The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of CPN/Aptech Computer Education Centre, Mrs. Joy Chukwereh Offor represented by the Director of Board/Company Legal Advisor, Barr. Alex Onyekuru in a remark thanked God for the millstone being recorded through the inauguration of the centre in Enugu, saying that their vision is to create employment and empower Nigerian youths.
Some of the reason Centre Point found it expedient to invest in the Computer Education Project, Offor said is because the graduates that were employed needed to be retrained and re-orientated to be able to cope with ever changing innovation in the information technology industry and this can positively affect the state in terms of engaging the idle mind meaningfully."
"Andela, an African company that identifies and develops software developers on Monday dismissed 250 Nigerians and Ugandan developers along with another 170 in Kenya.
Andela lets go of 250 developers in Nigeria
“Today, we are announcing that we are closing the D0 program in Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda.
“In addition, we will be letting go of approximately 250 Andelans in Nigeria and Uganda with an additional 170 potentially impacted in Kenya, who we don’t believe we’ll be able to find meaningful work for over the next year.”
“Moving forward, we will be focusing D0 training efforts on our pan-African hub in Rwanda”
“As a result, we’ve come to the conclusion that Andela’s next phase of growth requires a strategic shift in how we think about talent.”

On the other hand, the company will be hiring an additional 700 experienced engineers by the end of 2020 to efficiently handle the demand for experts by its partners.
“To continue creating junior engineering talent at scale, we will invest in the Andela Learning Community, through which we’ve already trained more than 30,000 learners in software engineering fundamentals.”
Andela is one of the engineering organisations in Africa with more than 1500 engineers and partners with over 200 technology companies worldwide."
"When Tolulope Komolafe first heard the pitch, she was skeptical. A fledgling company in Lagos, Nigeria, would pay her to learn how to write modern computer code and then offer her a good job in the high-tech economy.
“I thought it was a con,” she recalled. “Too good to be true.”
After inquiring, Ms. Komolafe found the offer was real. Today, she is a software developer, working remotely from Lagos for a start-up in New York, and she dreams of starting her own tech company someday.
Ms. Komolafe, a 27-year-old Nigerian, is one of hundreds of young Africans who have joined Andela, a fast-growing start-up based in New York that has attracted the attention and money of people like the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and works with blue-chip companies like Mastercard.
The company’s ambitious agenda spans education, economic development and moneymaking. It is betting on its ability to build out a talent pipeline of African software developers to the United States and elsewhere, tapping into a continent eager to connect to the global digital economy.

The animating idea behind Andela, founded in 2014, is that Africa has plenty of smart people, but that they too often lack the preparation for and pathways to gainful jobs — the missing ingredients that Andela can provide in the field of software development.
Not only does Andela instruct people in person, but 20,000 aspiring programmers across Africa have used its free online learning and training tools. By 2024, Andela hopes to have helped prepare 100,000 software developers in Africa for jobs, including thousands working for Andela.
After six months of paid training, the Andela employees become remote members of software development teams at companies. The current roster of 112 customers includes Viacom, Mastercard Labs, GitHub and SeatGeek in the United States, and clients in 10 other countries.
“This is a platform for giving people who want to learn and succeed access and opportunity,” said Seni Sulyman, a 32-year-old graduate of Harvard Business School, who is the country director for Andela in Nigeria.

The challenge for Andela will be expanding its model to meet its lofty growth targets. “Andela has delivered on its promise so far, but can it keep finding high-quality talent and finding relevant employment for them as it gets bigger?” asked Aniedi Udo-Obong, a Google program manager who works with software developers in Africa.
Andela’s growth plans got an enthusiastic endorsement this week from its financial backers, with a $40 million round of venture funding that lifts the total the company has raised to $80 million. The new investment was announced on Tuesday.
The start-up has attracted a group of top investors that find both its business model and its mission appealing, including GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Spark Capital.
It was also the first lead investment for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, set up in 2015 to eventually invest most of their Facebook wealth to “advance human potential and promote equality.”
During a tour of Africa last year, Mr. Zuckerberg visited Andela’s Lagos office and told the employees, “You are all part of something that’s really important.”

Spark Capital and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative were the lead investors in two earlier rounds of funding for Andela. CRE Venture Capital, based in Cape Town, South Africa, is the lead investor in the new $40 million round, the largest venture round led by an African firm, said Pule Taukobong, a founding partner of CRE Venture Capital.
Andela began with a founding team of six — three Africans, two Americans and a Canadian — and an initial test class of four students. It now employs 800 people, and it expects to double that number in the next year. While it has its headquarters in New York and a small office in San Francisco, 90 percent of its workers are in Africa, with offices in Lagos; Nairobi, Kenya; and Kampala, Uganda.
Though growing fast, Andela has been highly selective. Applicants undergo dozens of online drills to assess everything from technical ability to personality type. About 3 percent of the applicants are invited to a two-week boot camp, and a final cut takes the acceptance rate below 1 percent.
The new hires get a MacBook computer, subsidized housing and two meals a day during their six-month training program. In that time, Andela invests $15,000 in each developer. Starting salaries are low, but after the developers begin working as billable contractors for companies, their pay rises, up to $30,000 or so, comparable to salaries for young professionals in Africa’s urban centers.
Andela makes money much like consulting or law firms. It charges clients per worker, with part passed on to the worker as salary and Andela collecting the remainder. The company declined to detail its billing practices.
Andela’s recruits sign contracts for two years, but are expected to stay for four years. That longevity is part of the business model, since the work of developers on contract to customers helps pay to recruit and train new hires. So far, the retention rate is 98 percent.
None of the developers have hit the four-year threshold yet. Andela would be happy to have them stay beyond that, but it is also encouraging them to go work for other companies or start their own. It is setting up an Andela accelerator to nurture alumni start-ups.
“We want them to go out to become leading entrepreneurs and leading technologists in Africa,” Mr. Johnson said.
The Andela developers are young — the average age is under 25 — and 70 percent have computer science or engineering degrees. But university curriculums in Africa, technologists say, tend to emphasize theory rather than modern programming tools and the techniques of fast-paced software development in teams.

Olufunmilade Oshodi, a computer engineering major in college, had done some programming before, but his practical skills have been acquired since he joined Andela two years ago. Today Mr. Oshodi, 25, leads a group of eight Andela developers working for the Zebra, a car insurance comparison website based in Austin, Tex.
Last year, the company needed more engineering talent to expand. But with Google and Facebook hiring in Austin, the company did not want to compete in the escalating bidding war for local talent, said Meetesh Karia, Zebra’s chief technology officer.
Instead, it gave Andela a try.
The developers, Mr. Karia said, have worked out well — aided in part by Andela’s customized approach to outsourcing.
Andela sends its developers to customer sites to meet people and learn about the client’s business. Mr. Oshodi spent a month in Austin last year, and recently finished another three-week visit. He and the other Adela programmers have been invited to backyard barbecues and nights out in downtown Austin.
“They know my family. They know my kids,” Mr. Karia said. “They are really part of the team.”
The Andela developers are on the same corporate mailing lists and chat channels as Zebra employees. When back in Africa, the Andela members of the team participate in the daily “stand-up meeting,” where developers talk about their work and plans, usually via a video link.
One of the initial group of developers, Mr. Karia said, did not work out. But Andela soon replaced that person. Now, Mr. Karia said, “I would love to hire all eight” when their four-year commitments to Andela are over.
Mr. Oshodi’s four-year clock runs out in 2019. Until then, he said, he wants to steadily enhance his product development and management skills. He has not decided what comes next, but he is optimistic.
“If you put yourself in a good place,” Mr. Oshodi said, “opportunity comes.”"
